          Customize and extend the layers of specific named API atop

          by prims, their properties, and (optionally) their default 
          or fallback values. 

          The schema definition files are written in a simple, human
          readable, text-based markup language from the (.usda) file
          format. The files are then processed with this plugin tool
          to generate their corresponding C++, Python, and Swift API
          code.

          The generated C++, Python, and Swift code are then sent to
          the compiler to generate their corresponding API code, and
          made available to the USD runtime. Where it can be used to
          bring the schema definition to life, and make it available

 * Pixar's USD is a pretty complicated build. That being said, this single config
 * is less than 100 lines of code. Compare that to the ~21419 lines of CMake code
 * across ~156 files as of the current release branch, SwiftPM brings substantial
 * improvements which drive maintainability and readability, and that's before we
 * even get to the benefits of Swift, ...or the fact it's now connected to a very
 * capable package manager, in a lot of ways, this is a game changer. Through the
 * Swift Package Manager, we can now leverage the power of USD, and what it means
 * to build plugins, and applications, in a way that is much more accessible to
 * the wider community. This is a very exciting time for the USD project, and we
 * are very excited to be a part of it.
